                    I faced several problems while doing my school prep like notes, syllabus, pyp's, pyq's, etc. So, I made this to help students with all their needs like legit school notes, exam syllabus, doubt questions, mentorship, and toppers' guidance.

                    So, writing this at 3:22 am on Sun, 16 March. I got a thought: why am I doing all this trash, wasting my time on something for which I will get nothing? But I just want to help my juniors who are starting their journey of class 9, 10, 11, or any. I faced a lot of problems, which I will share here, knowing that no one will read this, but it's for my satisfaction. This website will not only be for studying. I will share my experiences, suggestions, friends, enemies, etc. Everything I can share, hoping that my identity will remain hidden. I have so much to talk about, which I will start sharing after tomorrow's English exam. I think anybody will open this website in April and after when they need notes or other things. But if you are here, then thanks a lot from my antaratma. Thanks again. <br>

                <p class="content">
                    <b>New post</b> very early, as I'm just going to sleep at 4:27 after lots of ratna. Now, I've decided to talk about friends. Everyone has seen best friends in TV shows like Nobita and Doraemon or friends like Shinchan and his group. But do we have friends like them? <b>This part is gonna hurt many.</b> I remember a day when our Hindi teacher (you know who) was giving us our results. He had cut my marks by mistake, or I don't know, and after convincing him for more than 15 minutes, when he was ready to give me marks, my whole classâ€”literally the whole classâ€”got against it. Shouting, "No sir, no, please," and whatnot. But in the batch of more than 20 students (of Hindi), there was not a single eye in favor of me or with me. That's not one instance; there are hundreds of these, like when one of my closest friends was fighting so that my marks could be decreased in a subject. That day, even when I was absent to argue or represent my side, he succeeded with some others whom I don't even know. <b>BRO, IF YOU ARE READING THIS, I THINK YES, THEN IT'S NOT OVER YET. IT STILL IGNITES A FIRE SOMEWHERE IN MY ANTARATMA.</b>

                    <b>Next will be a storytime about a special memory.</b><br>
