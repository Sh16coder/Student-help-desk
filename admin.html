                    <b>New post</b> very early as just going to sleep at 4:27 after lots of ratna . and now decided to talk about friends, everyone have seen best friends in tv shows like nobita doraemon, or friends like shinchan and his group. but do we have friends like them <b>this part gonna hurt many</b> . i remember a day when our hindi teacher you know who was giving us our results, he had cutted marks my msrks by mistake or i dont know and after convincing him for more than 15 min when he was ready to give marks my whole class literally whole class got against it . shouting no sir no please and what not . but in the batch of more than 20 students (of hindi) there was not a single eye in favour of me or with me . thats not one instance there are hundreds of this like when one of my closest friend was fighting so that my marks can be decreased in a subject .that day when even i was absent to argue or represent my side and he succeeded with some other whom i dont even know . <b>BRO IF YOU ARE READING THIS I THINK YES THEN ITS NOT OVER YET IT STILL IGNITES A FIRE SOMEWHERE IN MY ANTARATAMA</b>
